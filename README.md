Flower Species Prediction using Machine Learning
This project aims to predict the species of a flower based on its morphological features using machine learning algorithms. Leveraging the popular Iris dataset, the model classifies flower species by analyzing attributes such as sepal length, sepal width, petal length, and petal width. The goal is to demonstrate the application of supervised learning techniques for classification tasks.

Key Features:
Data Preprocessing: Efficient data cleaning, handling of missing values, normalization, and feature scaling to ensure high-quality input for model training.
Model Development: Implementation of various classification algorithms such as Logistic Regression, K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), Decision Trees, and Support Vector Machines (SVM) to accurately predict flower species.
Model Evaluation: Comprehensive evaluation using performance metrics, including accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and confusion matrix to assess the model's predictive capabilities.
Data Visualization: Visual representation of data through advanced plots (scatter plots, pair plots, etc.) to uncover patterns and relationships between features.
Technologies Used:
Programming Language: Python
Libraries: Scikit-Learn, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn
Tools: Jupyter Notebook
This repository provides a comprehensive implementation of a machine learning-based flower prediction system and serves as a foundation for understanding classification tasks in data science.
